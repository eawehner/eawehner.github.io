            <p>My name is Elizabeth Wehner and I am currently a student at UNC's Coding Bootcamp! I learned some web development on my own and wanted to continue to learn in a fast-paced environment solely focused on it. I'm the sort of person that once I know what I want, I'm getting it and I'm looking forward to my future as a Full-Stack Developer!</p>

            <p>At home I have 2 cats and 2 dogs...along with 2 <i>more</i> dogs who are staying with us for a while. To say they're a real handful would be putting it lightly, but they're all very sweet and more than worth the effort. We also have a garden that has been steadily growing over time and has supplied us with a lot of beautiful flowers and access to fresh and delicious fruits and vegetables.</p>

            <p>My other hobbies include writing and gaming. I love building things, be they houses in Minecraft, worlds in my stories, or webpages to share with the world. I like learning new things and using my skills to create things that wouldn't exist otherwise!</p>
